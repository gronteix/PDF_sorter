# This is **PDF_sorter**

Some people might have spent their past years in research downloading endless stacks of PDF documents without any proper sorting system. This *can* have consequences when writing a bibliography or a review article.

This Python module is an attempt to solve this problem. It extracts keywords from PDF documents and sorts the articles based on common topics. I hope it proves useful to some lost souls.
